# Contributing

Transactions Manager is an open source project, and we accept contributions
of all kinds: new lessons, fixes to existing material, bug
reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

## Working With GitHub

1.  Fork the `amauribechtoldjr/transactions-manager-server` repository on GitHub. _See the
    "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the screen on the GitHub website._

2.  Clone that repository to your own machine. (It is also possible
    to make minor edits right on GitHub.) _At your terminal:_

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/transactions-manager.git
    cd transactions-manager
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/amauribechtoldjr/transactions-manager-server.git
    ```

3.  Create a branch from `master` for your changes.
    Give your branch a meaningful name,
    such as `fix/new-endpoint`
    or `feature/add-new-validation-form`. _At your terminal:_

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/new-endpoint
    ```

4.  Commit the files you edited `git commit -m "New endpoint to update user avatar"`),
    and push your changes to your repository on GitHub
    (`git push origin fix/new-endpoint`).

5.  Send a pull request (PR) to the `master` branch of the
    `amauribechtoldjr/transactions-manager-server`.
